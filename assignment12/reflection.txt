Task 6: Reflection

1. Reflect on the differences between static and interactive visualizations.
Static visualizations cannot be altered by the end user while interactive visualizations
allow for the end user to engage and filter or modify the visualizations as permitted. 
In both cases the analyst will be in charge of how the dataset is presented or what 
data is showcased, but interactive visualizations give the end user more power to look
at the dataset.

2. Write a short paragraph discussing the advantages of using dashboards for real-time data exploration.
Advantages of using dashboards for real-time exploration include how analysis and insight
are always up to date and one can stay on top of any trends. This is expecially important
for time sensative analysis, which include keeping track of stock prices. When a dashboard
is interactive, depending on how it is built, one can also have the opportunity to focus in 
on a specific aspect of the analysis or one can zoom out and see the bigger picture.

3. Explain how interactive tools like Plotly and Dash can improve data communication in professional 
   settings.
Interactive tools allow for deeper understanding of a data set and also makes the data more
accessible. Another advantage is how it saves the analyst time with how the dashboard can be
more self-servicing, since, based on the functionaility of the dashboard, the user can 
filter the dataset as desired. It also allows for end users to engage with the data more
and can open the floor for more informed decisions, understanding, and collaboration.
